<p>After the court case, Dred Scott was returned to Irene Emerson. She felt that keeping them would be to risky, and returned them to the Blow family.  Peter Blow's children granted Dred Scott freedom and he finally got to be free. He and his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Dred Scott got a job as a porter in a hotel and was happy for a little while. Then, Dred Scott got tuberculosis and died on September 17, 1858. He was buried in St. Louis, in Calvary Cemetery. After Dred Scott died, the Civil War happened. Then the 14th amendment was added to the Constitution. This said that all people born in the U.S. were citizens. The 14th amendment undid the Dred Scott case, which said slaves were not citizens, even former slaves. Dred Scott was remembered as, “a simple man who wanted to be free.” In 1997, Dred and Harriet Scott were let into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. He wanted to be free and got it after a long struggle, just not in the way he planned.
